As we all know, **AI code is a big challenge for the "vibe coding" era.** 🌊💻

We're all generating code faster than ever, but let's be real—sometimes that AI-generated snippet works perfectly but is a security nightmare under the hood. Or it's just plain unmaintainable spaghetti. 🍝

That’s exactly why I built **CodeSentinel**. It’s designed to bridge the gap between "it works" and "it's production-ready."

I’m also excited to share that I'm working on making this into an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** soon, so you can plug these deep analysis agents directly into your own AI workflows! 🔌🤖

Here’s what CodeSentinel does right now:

🚀 **Deep Semantic Analysis**: Goes way beyond standard linters to understand the *intent* of your code, not just the syntax.
🛡️ **Security First**: Automatically checks against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. No more accidental hardcoded secrets or injection risks.
🧠 **AI-Powered Insights**: Uses Llama 3.3 (70B) to give you human-like explanations and fix suggestions.
📊 **Visual Control Flow**: Generates interactive graphs so you can literally *see* the logic paths in your complex functions.
⚡ **Multi-Language Support**: Handles everything from TypeScript and Python to Rust and Go.

It’s built for the modern dev who wants to keep the speed of AI coding but with the safety of a senior engineer's review.
